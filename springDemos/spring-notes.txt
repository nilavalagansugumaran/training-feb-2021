			- request - new object created for every request
			- session - new object created for every user sesions
			- websocket - each socket connection

	- How to access them?
		- from Spring containers - using ApplicationContext
		- @Autowired annotation 
			- dependency injection
			- @Qualifier - TO CHOOSE from multiple beans
		- @Lazy
		- can inject values from properties file 
			- using @Value
